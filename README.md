# workshop-GIT-test

<B> Hi Yasmine </B>

My first repository test

I use the following manual:
https://inbo.github.io/git-course/course_rstudio.html 

I have a :cat: called Monty.

The previous sentence was just to test if I could update a README.md file.
And yes I can!

## How to add multiple commits from one file

I will divide this README.md in two commits,

part 1. I love the :sun:

part 2. I also like the :rain:

## Add new file fruits.csv

inside the map "data" there is a file called "fruits.csv"
